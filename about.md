# About Willem Melis(under construction)

## Interested in:

- System theory
- System identification
- Machine learning
- Differential equations
- Stochastic differential equations
- Network and server administration

### books i am reading right now:
1. Deep learning, Ian goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio
2. Gandhi an autobiography
3. The theoretical minimum (classical mechanics)

## Education:
My formal education is somewhat unorthodox, i started very low with a basic electronics bachelor degree. And worked my way up to Mathematical engineering. This means that i have a lot more hands on experience then a lot of my fellow students. On the other hand it did take me longer to get where i am right now then my fellow students.

### Bachelor of electronics (khbo)
A very hands on bachelor degree, lots of projects,internship, etcetera. The most interesting classes for me where about system engineering. I am still trying keep up with the more recent developments in system engineering. Nevertheless i am not looking to become a system engineer.

### Master of Electronics and ICT engineering technology option ICT (Kuleuven-Oostende)
After my bachelor degree i did a preparation program of a year for this master degree. And in 2015 i finished this degree, with a thesis in the domain of Linux Embedded software. The goal of the thesis was to isolate a process in Linux, so that this isolated process could run critical tasks. One of my promoters wrote a paper about this:  Isolating real-time from processor-intensive processes in embedded multi-core systems by Piet Cordemans.

### Master of mathematical engineering (KuLeuven: graduation in 2018, still in progress)
After finishing my Master degree in Oostende, i wanted to strengthen my knowledge in applied mathematics. I took my classes towards numerical simulation, system theory, numerical linear algebra and machine learning.
