# About Willem Melis

## Interested in:
- Programming languages/paradigms
- Compilers/Codegenerators
- System/Control theory and machine learning
- Logic

### books i am reading right now:
1. Programming in Haskell
2. From Mathematics to Generics (Stepanov)
3. To mock a Mockingbird (Smullyan)

## Education:
My formal education is somewhat unorthodox, I started very privatical with an electronics bachelor degree. And worked my way up to Mathematical engineering. This means that I have a lot more hands on experience then a lot of my fellow students. On the other hand it did take me longer to get where I am right now then my fellow students.

### Bachelor of electronics (khbo)
A very hands on degree, lots of projects, internship, etcetera. The most interesting classes for me where about system engineering. I am still trying keep up with the more recent developments in system engineering. Nevertheless I am not looking to become a system engineer.

### Master of Electronics and ICT engineering technology option ICT (Kuleuven-Oostende)
After my bachelor degree I did a preparation program of a year for this master degree. And in 2015 I finished this degree, with a thesis in the domain of Linux Embedded software. The goal of the thesis was to isolate a process in Linux, so that this isolated process could run critical tasks. One of my promoters wrote a paper about this:  Isolating real-time from processor-intensive processes in embedded multi-core systems by Piet Cordemans.

### Master of mathematical engineering (KuLeuven: graduation in 2018, still in progress)
After finishing my Master degree in Oostende, I wanted to strengthen my knowledge in applied mathematics. I took my classes towards numerical simulation, system theory, numerical linear algebra and machine learning. In my final year I wrote a libary to generate control systems. The code is release under an MIT license, and can be found at githib.com/kul-forbes/nmpc-codegen.

### Working at Verotech
After I graduated I went to work for Verotech writing logistic optimization software at ArcerlorMittal in C# and C++. 
I introduced some new concepts from functional programming in the department, and noticed a reduction in code/bugs and development time. This has encouraged me to go further down the rabbit hole and learn programming languages and try to apply their techniques in C#/C++.
Most of my work was done in C#, I also wrote an C# codegenerator, but this time with less succes. Nevertheless it has has triggered my interest in Codegenerators/Compilers.
