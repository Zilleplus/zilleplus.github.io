# About Willem Melis

## Interested in:
- System/Control theory and machine learning
- Programming languages/paradigms
- Logic
- Compilers/Codegenerators

I am a software engineering working at Marelec, I am responsible for writing heuristics to find cutting patterns used by the new water-jet. 

I have 2 master degreeâ€™s one is ICT/electronics and Mathematical engineering, they complement each other very nicely. I did projects/internship writing software at Proferro an Artilium both of them were in data gathering. I am also the author of a python code generation library related optimal control, that was used in several papers.

After I graduated, I went to work as a Verotech consultant at ArcelorMittal, where I was part of the team handling heuristics to automate all the cranes. And a was responsible for a slab cutting heuristic.

When Corona hit my consulting job at Arcelor was a bit volatile. My operational research background from Arcelor was very useful to Marelec.  As they were trying to implement some more complicated cutting heuristics, but had no people with experience in this. My math+electronics background allowed me to handle the whole process from specification and research too and the low level actual implementation and testing.
