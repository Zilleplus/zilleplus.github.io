# Welcome to the personal page of Willem Melis (Site is under construction)

I am a Belgian engineer/ engineering student see [about](about.md) to find out more about me. Check out some of [my finished projects](project.md) that i personally found interesting.

## What am i working on right now?
At the moment I am working on my master thesis to finish my degree of Mathematical engineering. The title of the thesis is: Newton-type operator splitting methods for embedded model predictive control. More info on the [github page](https://github.com/kul-forbes/nmpc-codegen) 

## Side project
In my spare time I am playing around with Openwrt on tp-link access points. I am trying to create a free-wifi access point that requires an email authentication but without a central server. And this while the access point has only 4MB of flash to fit everything on.
